    "- Nothing that is saved to Git is ever lost, so you can always go back to see which results were generated by which versions of your programs.\n",

    "- Git automatically notifies you when your work conflicts with someone else's, so it's harder (but not impossible) to accidentally overwrite work.\n",

    "This command can also be used to go back even further into a file's history and restore versions of that file from a commit.  \n",

    "then git checkout 2242bd report.txt would replace the current version of report.txt with the version that was committed on October 16.   \n",

    "  \n",
    "Restoring a file doesn't erase any of the repository's history.  \n",
    "Instead, the act of restoring the file is saved as another commit, because you might later want to undo your undoing.  \n",
