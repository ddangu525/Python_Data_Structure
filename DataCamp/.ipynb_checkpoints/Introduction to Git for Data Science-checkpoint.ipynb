    "  \n",
    "- Nothing that is saved to Git is ever lost, so you can always go back to see which results were generated by which versions of your programs.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Git automatically notifies you when your work conflicts with someone else's, so it's harder (but not impossible) to accidentally overwrite work.\n",

    "- Git can synchronize work done by different people on different machines, so it scales as your team does.\n",
